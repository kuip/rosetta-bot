# rosetta-bot

Research project for building an automatic natural language translator.

Rosetta-bot is using the [IHTSDO](http://www.ihtsdo.org/) medical terminology SNOMED CT in English, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Canadian French (partial translation), under an Affiliate License - Research Agreement. The scope is to create a semi-automated translation, based on the words and terms found in the current literature, as well as on the already available translations.

## Crowdsourcing Translations

An extension of this project is a web and mobile app for crowdsourcing translations:
